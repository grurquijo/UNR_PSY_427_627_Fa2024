# (1) Get all images that match a certain pattern (i.e. contain some sub-string) from a directory. The directory and sub-string should be the inputs, and a list or cell array of file names should be the output
def get_images(dir:str, options:list, ):
    pass

# (2) Collect responses
def get_responses(key_response:str):
    return key_out, key_time
    

# (3) Set up the screen.
def screen_setup(screen_size, fullscreen:bool, screen_color:str):
    
    return win
    

# Inputs should be:

# screen size

# a boolean (True/False) variable for fullscreen or not that defaults to NOT fullscreen

# screen color

# the function should return:

# the screen window object or handle (win, in most of the example code you have).

# You should have a separate function to make a trial plan for all (n) trials.

# You should write your code to be flexible enough to quickly implement a change in image directory (to show other same/different images). That will be your next assignment!
